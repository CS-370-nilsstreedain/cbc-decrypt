# CBC Decrypt
Greetings,

Please proceed to the `cbc-decrypt` folder under `week3`; a challenge is waiting for us.

Your job is to find the key used for `cbc` encryption. We first provide `encrypted_flag` to you: that contains data and the data is encrypted by using `cbc`. We also provide a list of `passwords` that will be the candidate keys. Your job is to find which `key` leads to the decrypted plaintext data that starts with `cs370`. Once you're successful, you will have the flag.

Good luck
